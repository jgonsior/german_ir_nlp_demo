# Harry Potter - German IR NLP Demo Overview

Welcome to the Harry Potter Information Retrieval Natural Language Processing project, specially designed for the Long Night of Sciences in Dresden (2024). This project features a custom-trained ColBERT model focused on the magical world of Harry Potter, with a particular emphasis on being trained in German. The following chapters provide a comprehensive guide to the codebase and methodologies employed throughout this project, ensuring a detailed understanding of the steps taken to develop and refine this unique language model, as well as the steps inquired to execute the code successfully.

## Wissenschaftskommunikation

This folder contains the code and resources used for the `Wissenschaftskommunikation` during the Long Night of Science and Technology (LNDW) in Dresden. It encompasses various scripts, datasets, and materials created for the event, including colored barcodes, LaTeX files, and sliding-window methods. These tools demonstrate the intersection of language processing and scientific communication, focusing on creating engaging and educational content. The `README.md` inside the folder provides detailed instructions on the prerequisites, installation, and usage of the code.

## Backend

This folder contains the code and resources used for the `Backend` during the LNDW. It encompasses a ColBERT based mode for answering queries, as well as multiple components, such as preprocessing, query generation, the actual API to connect the Backend with the Frontend and a baseline tf-idf model. The `README.md` inside the folder provides detailed instructions on the prerequisites, installation, and usage of the code.

## Frontend

This folder contains the code and resources used for the `Frontend` during the LNDW. It encompasses an AngularJS based webpage devided into multiple components, the assets for the webpage styling and any other necessary code or files that are needed to create the `Frontend` for the project. The Frontend demonstrates the search engines capabilites and abilities focusing on a educational visualization of the underlying mechanisms. The `README.md` inside the folder provides detailed instructions on the prerequisites, installation, and usage of the code.
